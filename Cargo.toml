# Hard-code rand to 0.4.3
#
# Reason for this is this dependency chain:
# diesel -> uuid (0.6) -> rand (0.4)
# but rand 0.4.5 depends on fuchsia-cprng which has an unclear license
# rand 0.4.4 is yanked, rand 0.4.3 does not contain this dependency.
#
# We do not explicitely need this dependency, we just want to force cargo not to
# link against rand 0.4.5 because of this licensing issue.
#
# The proper solution for this would be to update "uuid" in diesel or
# to update "rand" in uuid 0.6.
#
# Upstream issue: https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1071
